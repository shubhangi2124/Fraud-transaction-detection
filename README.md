# Fraud-transaction-detection

Payments related fraud is a key aspect of cyber-crime agencies and recent research has 
shown that machine learning techniques can be applied successfully to detect fraudulent 
transactions in large amounts of payments data. Such techniques have the ability to 
detect fraudulent transactions that human auditors may not be able to catch and also do 
this on a real time basis.  
In this project, we apply multiple supervised machine learning techniques to the problem 
of fraud detection using a publicly available simulated payment transactions data. We aim 
to demonstrate how supervised ML techniques can be used to classify data with high 
class imbalance with high accuracy. 
We demonstrate that exploratory analysis can be used to separate fraudulent and non
fraudulent transactions. We also demonstrate that for a well separated dataset, tree
based algorithms like Random Forest work much better than Logistic Regression.
